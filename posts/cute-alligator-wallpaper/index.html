Looking to update your home with a fresh new look? Peeling wallpaper is a quick and easy way to do so! Here are a few tips on how to peel wallpaper the right way:</p><ol><li><p>Start by scoring the wallpaper with a scoring tool.

Start at a corner or seam and slowly peel it away from the wall.</p></li><li><p>If you come across any stubborn areas, simply score them again and mist with water until they loosen up.</p></li><li><p>Once all of the wallpaper is removed, wipe down the walls with a damp cloth to remove any residue.</p></li></ol><h2 id=27-alligator-hd-wallpapers--backgrounds---wallpaper-abyss>27 Alligator HD Wallpapers | Backgrounds - Wallpaper Abyss<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#27-alligator-hd-wallpapers--backgrounds---wallpaper-abyss>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://images3.alphacoders.com/742/thumb-350-742070.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.eTTrgXgsgHXfKw7IeRG53wAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="27 Alligator HD Wallpapers | Backgrounds - Wallpaper Abyss"><p><em>Source: wall.alphacoders.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Members: Who are the members of BTS?
