If you&rsquo;re looking for a way to add some personality to your computer or phone, why not create a custom logo wallpaper? It&rsquo;s a great way to show off your company&rsquo;s brand, or just make your device more personal.

This could be your company&rsquo;s logo, or an illustration that captures the essence of what you do.</p></li><li><p>Keep it simple. A busy background can be distracting and make your logo hard to see. Stick to one or two colors for maximum impact.</p></li><li><p>Make sure the resolution is high enough so that it looks sharp on your device&rsquo;s screen. Otherwise, it&rsquo;ll just look fuzzy and low-quality.</p></li></ol><p>With these tips in mind, creating a custom logo wallpaper is easy and fun!</p><h2 id=camp-cretaceous-fanart-on-tumblr>#camp Cretaceous Fanart On Tumblr<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#camp-cretaceous-fanart-on-tumblr>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://64.media.tumblr.com/4cf53a11f55ddc508f55a9c892f9c3de/49eea2e3fe7da49b-d5/s2048x3072/4443166bb4f00a23f216973fc34f081f4ffed903.png onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.ZEvcqgrSqRqd9Gby2Ib_0wHaH6&pid=15.1"' alt="#camp cretaceous fanart on Tumblr"><p><em>Source: tumblr.com</em></p><blockquote><p>cretaceous pincus.</p></blockquote><p>Minimalist design: How can white wallpaper create a feeling of space and simplicity?
