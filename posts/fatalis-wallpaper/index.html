Kawaii culture originated in Japan, specifically in the cities of Tokyo and Osaka. Kawaii culture is characterized by its typically round or heart-shaped facial features, simple and pastel colors, and characteristic anime-inspired graphics. These characteristics arose from a desire among Japanese youth to look cute and stylish.
The term &ldquo;kawaii&rdquo; was first used in the 1970s to describe Japanese comic books and animation that were aimed at children. At this time, many children in Japan were wearing colorful clothing inspired by these works, which gave rise to the Japanese expression &ldquo;kawaii ga suki,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;I like it cute.&rdquo; Kawaii became popularized outside of Japan during the 1990s when people began using it as a way to describe things that are visually pleasing or charming.</p><h2 id=smilodon-fatalis-1-by-fredthedinosaurman-in-2020--smilodon>Smilodon Fatalis #1 By Fredthedinosaurman In 2020 | Smilodon<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#smilodon-fatalis-1-by-fredthedinosaurman-in-2020--smilodon>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/aa/f5/bb/aaf5bb3db5a0177b010cbeb5f72c7ec3.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.Rn-3ExSR4PE_NuBqAxC8pgHaEP&pid=15.1"' alt="Smilodon fatalis #1 by Fredthedinosaurman in 2020 | Smilodon"><p><em>Source: pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>smilodon fatalis prehistoric fredthedinosaurman spinosaurus extinct wierum grins toothy.</p></blockquote><p>Advantages and disadvantages of each type
