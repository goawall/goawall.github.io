What is minimalism?
In its simplest form, minimalism is the intentional promotion of the things we most value and the removal of everything that distracts us from them. This can be applied to many areas of life, including but not limited to our physical possessions, the food we eat, the way we spend our time, and even the thoughts we think.</p><p>When it comes to our physical possessions, minimalists believe that less is more. We only keep things that serve a purpose or bring us joy, and get rid of anything that doesn’t fall into those categories. This decluttering process can be liberating and empowering, as it allows us to focus on what’s truly important to us.</p><p>Minimalism also extends to the food we eat.</p><h2 id=bc51-anime-girl-spring-japan-art-illustration-wallpaper>Bc51-anime-girl-spring-japan-art-illustration-wallpaper<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#bc51-anime-girl-spring-japan-art-illustration-wallpaper>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://papers.co/wallpaper/papers.co-bc51-anime-girl-spring-japan-art-illustration-34-iphone6-plus-wallpaper.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.K2QWrfScVwKqeNUsdS2vggHaNK&pid=15.1"' alt=bc51-anime-girl-spring-japan-art-illustration-wallpaper><p><em>Source: papers.co</em></p><blockquote><p>bc51.</p></blockquote><p>Artificial intelligence is increasingly becoming a part of our everyday lives, from the way we interact with our devices to the way we drive our cars.
