Making your own funny wallpaper is easy and can be a lot of fun. You can use any picture you want, but it&rsquo;s best to use one that is high resolution so it doesn&rsquo;t get pixelated when you stretch it out. You can also add text to your wallpaper to make it even funnier. To do this, simply open up a photo editing program like Photoshop or GIMP and add whatever text you want. Make sure the font is large enough to see and that the color contrasts well with the background image. Once you&rsquo;re done, save the image and then set it as your desktop wallpaper.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://goawall.github.io/tags/wallpaper-photos-images/>wallpaper photos images</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://goawall.github.io/posts/dukes-of-hazzard-car-wallpaper/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Dukes Of Hazzard Car Wallpaper : Dukes Of Hazzard 01 Car By Pitchblackreaper On Deviantart</span></a>
