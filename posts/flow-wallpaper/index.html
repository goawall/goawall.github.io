Or go with stripes or polka dots.</p></li><li><p>Stick to traditional colors like navy, red, and green. Or go with a more subdued palette of pale blues and grays.</p></li><li><p>Consider the overall style of your home when choosing preppy wallpaper.

A lock wallpaper is a image, usually personal, that a user sets as the background on their device&rsquo;s home screen. While this may seem like a fun and convenient way to add some personality to your device, there are some disadvantages to using a lock wallpaper.
For starters, if you choose an image that is too busy or has too much going on, it can be difficult to read your device&rsquo;s icons and information. A lock wallpaper can also make it more difficult to find certain apps - if everything is blends together in the background, it can be time consuming to locate what you&rsquo;re looking for.</p><p>In addition, depending on the quality of the image you use, a lock wallpaper can actually drain your battery faster. This is because higher quality images tend to require more processing power, which in turn uses more battery power.</p><h2 id=monarch-butterfly-and-yellow-lanthana-desktop-wallpaper-full-screen>Monarch Butterfly And Yellow Lanthana Desktop Wallpaper Full Screen<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#monarch-butterfly-and-yellow-lanthana-desktop-wallpaper-full-screen>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://www.wallpapers13.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/Monarch-Butterfly-and-Yellow-Lanthana-Desktop-Wallpaper-full-screen-1600x1200.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.ZjCVDOPTr0vwFhnrTwhXgQHaFj&pid=15.1"' alt="Monarch Butterfly And Yellow Lanthana Desktop Wallpaper Full Screen"><p><em>Source: wallpapers13.com</em></p><blockquote><p>butterfly desktop monarch yellow screen wallpapers13 wallpapersafari.</p></blockquote><p>How to Customize Mac Wallpaper
