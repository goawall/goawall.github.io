Pig wallpaper, also known as mud plaster or render, is a type of wall covering made from a mixture of plaster and pigments. The different types of brushes used to apply pig wallpaper are the roller brush, the trowel, and the scraper.

And if you have a lot of programs open at once, the wallpaper can make it harder for your computer to keep up.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re looking for a way to personalize your computer without causing any headaches, stick to simpler wallpapers or even just a solid color.
