The girl wallpaper dates back to the 18th century and was first popularized in France. It became widely used in Britain during the 19th century. The girl wallpaper is usually made of paper or fabric and is decorated with images of young girls.
The girl wallpaper became popular because it was a symbol of innocence and purity. The girls depicted on the wallpaper were usually between the ages of four and seven.
