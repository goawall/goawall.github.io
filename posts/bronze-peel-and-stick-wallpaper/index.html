As the 21st century began, one popular trend amongst interior designers was to incorporate Tim Burton-esque artwork into their homes. This style has since evolved and is now known as &ldquo;legends wallpaper.&rdquo; The idea behind legends wallpaper is to use an eclectic mix of images and patterns, all inspired by famous figures in history or world-renowned artists.
Some of the most popular legends wallpaper designs include those inspired by Tim Burton, M.C. Escher, Vincent van Gogh, and Salvador Dalí. Each designer provides a unique perspective on the world of art, resulting in an incredibly diverse collection of wallpapers that can be used for any interior design style. Whether you&rsquo;re looking for a trendy new look for your home or want to add a touch of class and sophistication, legends wallpaper is sure to inspire you!</p><h2 id=peel-and-stick-metal-geometric-wallpaper-brushed-silveramp-gold--etsy>Peel And Stick Metal Geometric Wallpaper Brushed Silver& Gold | Etsy<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#peel-and-stick-metal-geometric-wallpaper-brushed-silveramp-gold--etsy>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.etsystatic.com/27947674/r/il/ebab17/2928289286/il_fullxfull.2928289286_34wm.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.jAf9rwER9QzuU95Eb1r5cQHaHa&pid=15.1"' alt="Peel and Stick Metal Geometric Wallpaper Brushed Silver& Gold | Etsy"><p><em>Source: etsy.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Tips for hanging gold wallpaper: If you&rsquo;re planning on hanging gold wallpaper in your home, there are a few things you should keep in mind.
