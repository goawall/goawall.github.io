When it comes to choosing wallpaper, there are a few things to consider. First, what kind of room is the wall going in? Is it a formal living room with traditional furniture? Or is it a more laid-back space like a bedroom where you can let your imagination run wild?
Another thing to consider is the color of the walls. If you have colorful walls and want something neutral to work with, gray might be a good option. It won&rsquo;t clash with any other colors in the room and it&rsquo;ll also look clean and modern. On the other hand, if you have walls that are mostly white or light colors, gray might not be the right choice because it will look too boring and basic.</p><p>Then there&rsquo;s the matter of style.</p><h2 id=sketching-ideas>Sketching Ideas<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#sketching-ideas>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="http://photos1.blogger.com/blogger/3927/2325/320/blue willow.jpg" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.Ezg53TaewKfyYjKXfGXMZwEjDW&pid=15.1"' alt="Sketching Ideas"><p><em>Source: sketchingideas.blogspot.com</em></p><blockquote><p>willow.</p></blockquote><p>what is green wallpaper?
