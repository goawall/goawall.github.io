First, consider what type of image you want as your background. Do you want something that&rsquo;s cute and girly? Or are you looking for something more masculine? Maybe you want something that&rsquo;s abstract or creative. Once you&rsquo;ve decided on the general style of the image, it will be easier to narrow down your choices.</p><p>Next, take into account the resolution of your device&rsquo;s screen. You&rsquo;ll want to choose an image that&rsquo;s high-resolution so it looks sharp and clear on your screen.
