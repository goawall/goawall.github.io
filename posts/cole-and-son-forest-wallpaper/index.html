In order to remove wallpaper, the first step is to score the wallpaper. This can be done with a utility knife or a scoring tool. The goal is to create small holes in the paper so that the backing can be removed more easily.
Once the wallpaper is scored, the next step is to apply a stripping solution. This will help to loosen the glue and make it easier to remove the wallpaper. There are a variety of stripping solutions available, so be sure to read the labels carefully before making a purchase.</p><p>After applying the stripping solution, let it sit for at least 15 minutes before attempting to remove the wallpaper. Use a putty knife or scraper to gently peel away the paper. Start at a corner and work your way around the room until all of the wallpaper is removed.</p><h2 id=cole-amp-son---woods-wallpaper>Cole & Son - Woods Wallpaper<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#cole-amp-son---woods-wallpaper>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://www.finestwallpaper.com/uploads/5/7/7/9/5779447/s774058804322417752_p2979_i7_w160.jpeg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.hx8M4ga0VW1sqLAHly2RpQAAAA&pid=15.1"' alt="Cole & Son - Woods Wallpaper"><p><em>Source: finestwallpaper.com</em></p><blockquote><p>cole woods son.</p></blockquote><p>How to set an HD wallpaper on your computer
