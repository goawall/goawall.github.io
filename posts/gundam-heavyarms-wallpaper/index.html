When it comes to wallpaper, there are two options: hire a professional or do it yourself. If you decide to take on the project yourself, there are a few things you need to know. First, choose the right type of wallpaper. There are three main types of wallpaper: vinyl-coated, paper-backed and fabric-backed. Vinyl-coated wallpaper is the most durable and easiest to clean; paper-backed wallpaper is the least durable but easiest to install; and fabric-backed wallpaper is somewhere in between. Second, make sure you have all the tools you need before you start. You will need a measuring tape, level, pencil, straight edge, utility knife and paste brush. Third, calculate how much wallpaper you will need before you start buying.
