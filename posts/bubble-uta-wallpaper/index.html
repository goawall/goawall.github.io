The following are guidelines for keeping wallpaper looking its best:
-Wiping down walls with a damp cloth every week will remove any dust or dirt and keep the surface clean.
-If the wallpaper seems to be fading, using an anti-fade product occasionally can help prolong the look of your wallpaper.
-Regularly checking for spilt food or drinks on the wall can help prevent staining, as well as bringing attention to potential areas of damage.
-Regularly cleaning and dusting the frames that hold up your wallpaper can keep them looking young and new.</p><h2 id=about-utau--tumblr>About Utau | Tumblr<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#about-utau--tumblr>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://64.media.tumblr.com/c1f3c57a677151df3a0d58e02fa1308d/tumblr_ourr97K7oX1v57xu9o2_500.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.oLz9vDfMAd-5p0rbEATbwwHaKJ&pid=15.1"' alt="about utau | Tumblr"><p><em>Source: tumblr.com</em></p><blockquote><p>utau.</p></blockquote><p>In the past, wallpaper was made of paper and applied to walls with a brush or roller.
