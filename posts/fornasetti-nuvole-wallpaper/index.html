In 1867, English author Charlotte Perkins Gilman wrote “The Yellow Wallpaper,” a short story about a woman who is slowly driven insane by the yellow wallpaper in her bedroom. The story is a feminist critique of the treatment of women during the Victorian era. In the story, the protagonist’s husband, a doctor, forbids her from doing anything that might excite her, including reading and writing. He believes that if she rests and takes care of her health, she will be cured of her “nervous condition.” However, the protagonist becomes increasingly obsessed with the wallpaper in her room, which she believes is hiding a figure that is trying to escape. The story concludes with the protagonist tearing off the wallpaper and crawling into a hole behind it. Gilman’s story was inspired by her own experience with postpartum depression.\n..OUR NEW WALLPAPER 'NUVOLE' BY COLE \u0026 SON @ GESCHWISTERLIEBE Source: pinterest.com\ncloud cole son ceiling fornasetti wallpapers tapete stuttgart designs nuvole geschwisterliebe piero ltd.\nAdvantages: why choose green wallpaper?

In 1867, English author Charlotte Perkins Gilman wrote &ldquo;The Yellow Wallpaper,&rdquo; a short story about a woman who is slowly driven insane by the yellow wallpaper in her bedroom. The story is a feminist critique of the treatment of women during the Victorian era. In the story, the protagonist&rsquo;s husband, a doctor, forbids her from doing anything that might excite her, including reading and writing. He believes that if she rests and takes care of her health, she will be cured of her &ldquo;nervous condition.&rdquo; However, the protagonist becomes increasingly obsessed with the wallpaper in her room, which she believes is hiding a figure that is trying to escape. The story concludes with the protagonist tearing off the wallpaper and crawling into a hole behind it.
Gilman&rsquo;s story was inspired by her own experience with postpartum depression.</p><h2 id=our-new-wallpaper-039nuvole039-by-cole-amp-son--geschwisterliebe>..OUR NEW WALLPAPER 'NUVOLE' BY COLE & SON @ GESCHWISTERLIEBE<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#our-new-wallpaper-039nuvole039-by-cole-amp-son--geschwisterliebe>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/originals/38/e1/fb/38e1fb952db3956bfd77a14a850784e7.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP._fWn1NNAARdOGK4EMKG13wHaL2&pid=15.1"' alt="..OUR NEW WALLPAPER 'NUVOLE' BY COLE & SON @ GESCHWISTERLIEBE"><p><em>Source: pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>cloud cole son ceiling fornasetti wallpapers tapete stuttgart designs nuvole geschwisterliebe piero ltd.</p></blockquote><p>Advantages: why choose green wallpaper?
