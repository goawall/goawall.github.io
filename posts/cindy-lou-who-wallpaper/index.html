Traditional floral wallpaper is typically made up of brightly colored blooms arranged in a symmetrical or botanical pattern. This type of wallpaper is often used in children&rsquo;s rooms or as an accent in a more formal setting.
Modern floral wallpaper can be quite abstract and feature swirls, lines, and other geometric shapes instead of traditional flowers. This type of wallpaper can be used in a variety of settings, from the living room to the bedroom. Abstract floral wallpaper can also be a great way to add some personality to a room without being too flashy.</p><p>There are also versions of floral wallpaper that are both modern and abstract. These types of prints feature large, colorful blooms that may or may not be organized into traditional patterns.
