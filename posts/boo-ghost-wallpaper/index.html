What is Kawaii?
Kawaii, or &ldquo;cute&rdquo; in Japanese, is a style of art and design that emphasizes the aesthetic appeal of small, often whimsical details. It can be seen in everything from wallpaper to clothing to decorative items. The term itself has origins in Japan&rsquo;s pop culture, where it was originally used to describe cute and pint-sized characters and objects in anime and manga.
