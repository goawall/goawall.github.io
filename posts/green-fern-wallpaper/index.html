War wallpaper is a type of wallpaper that became popular in the early nineteenth century. It is usually a dark color with military or patriotic scenes printed on it. Early war wallpapers were often hand-painted and expensive. They were often used to line the walls of homes of wealthy families or government officials. In the mid-nineteenth century, mass production of war wallpaper became possible, making it more affordable and available to the general public. By the early twentieth century, war wallpaper was used in both private homes and public spaces such as offices and schools. It remains popular today as a way to show support for one&rsquo;s country or as a decorative element in a room.</p><h2 id=waterfall-rocks-moss-green-forest-tree-fern-australian-rainforest>Waterfall, Rocks, Moss Green Forest Tree Fern Australian Rainforest<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#waterfall-rocks-moss-green-forest-tree-fern-australian-rainforest>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://www.wallpapers13.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Waterfall-rocks-moss-green-forest-tree-fern-Australian-rainforest-Desktop-Wallpaper-HD-1280x960.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.ji8fTBjHkkIsdLAzfhQcMgHaFj&pid=15.1"' alt="Waterfall, Rocks, Moss Green Forest Tree Fern Australian Rainforest"><p><em>Source: wallpapers13.com</em></p><blockquote><p>waterfall forest rainforest tree fern rocks desktop moss australian wallpapers13.</p></blockquote><p>Natural materials: Wallpaper made from natural materials such as bamboo, grasscloth, and cork can add textural interest to a space.
