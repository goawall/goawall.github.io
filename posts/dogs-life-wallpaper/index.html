This can be especially useful if you want to create a unique and personalized interior design without spending a fortune on custom wallpaper designs.
Some other benefits of using living wallpapers include the fact that they&rsquo;re energy-efficient, since you won&rsquo;t need to use as much power to keep them moving; they also look great in any room, regardless of its size; and finally, they&rsquo;re easy to maintain - all you need is some water and a little soap to keep them looking fresh.</p><h2 id=dog039s-life>Dog's Life<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#dog039s-life>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="http://www.palosverdes.com/roseannah/gloria_plascencia/images/animals/Dogs - 010.jpg" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.C7qSCafRyeYeyXbM_xGKJQHaF5&pid=15.1"' alt="Dog's Life"><p><em>Source: palosverdes.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>How to use aesthetic wallpaper

In the end, the narrator is successful in driving the woman mad. She becomes so obsessed with the wallpaper that she tears it off the walls in an attempt to free the woman she believes is trapped inside.
