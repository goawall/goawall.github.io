In 1867, English author Charlotte Perkins Gilman wrote “The Yellow Wallpaper,” a short story about a woman who is slowly driven insane by the yellow wallpaper in her bedroom. The story is a feminist critique of the treatment of women during the Victorian era. In the story, the protagonist’s husband, a doctor, forbids her from doing anything that might excite her, including reading and writing. He believes that if she rests and takes care of her health, she will be cured of her “nervous condition.” However, the protagonist becomes increasingly obsessed with the wallpaper in her room, which she believes is hiding a figure that is trying to escape. The story concludes with the protagonist tearing off the wallpaper and crawling into a hole behind it. Gilman’s story was inspired by her own experience with postpartum depression.\n@FENTOLOGY In 2021 | Cute Poses For Pictures, Light Skin Boys, Curly Source: pinterest.com\n.\nA new trend in home décor is using 3D wallpaper to create a unique and interesting look in any room.

It is a great way to add a touch of nature to your home décor.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://goawall.github.io/tags/wallpaper-photos-images/>wallpaper photos images</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://goawall.github.io/posts/chenonceau-wallpaper/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Chenonceau Wallpaper ~ Chenonceau Castle France Chambord Staircase Leonardo Da Chateau Château Castles Vinci Cher River French Wallpapers Where Architecture Flickr Bu Thejigsawpuzzles</span></a>
