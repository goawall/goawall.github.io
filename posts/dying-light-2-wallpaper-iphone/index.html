In the story, the protagonist&rsquo;s husband, a doctor, forbids her from doing anything that might excite her, including reading and writing. He believes that if she rests and takes care of her health, she will be cured of her &ldquo;nervous condition.&rdquo; However, the protagonist becomes increasingly obsessed with the wallpaper in her room, which she believes is hiding a figure that is trying to escape. The story concludes with the protagonist tearing off the wallpaper and crawling into a hole behind it.
Gilman&rsquo;s story was inspired by her own experience with postpartum depression.</p><h2 id=dying-light-2-4k-8k-wallpapers--hd-wallpapers--id-24515>Dying Light 2 4K 8K Wallpapers | HD Wallpapers | ID #24515<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#dying-light-2-4k-8k-wallpapers--hd-wallpapers--id-24515>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://www.hdwallpapers.in/download/dying_light_2_4k_8k-2048x2048.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.ChgPSqQhfd_AU6p1FQ_PcQHaHa&pid=15.1"' alt="Dying Light 2 4K 8K Wallpapers | HD Wallpapers | ID #24515"><p><em>Source: hdwallpapers.in</em></p><blockquote><p>dying light 4k 8k wallpapers resolutions 5s iphone.</p></blockquote><ol start=3><li>Benefits of using basketball wallpaper
