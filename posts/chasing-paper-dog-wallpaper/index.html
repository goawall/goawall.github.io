In 1867, English author Charlotte Perkins Gilman wrote “The Yellow Wallpaper,” a short story about a woman who is slowly driven insane by the yellow wallpaper in her bedroom. The story is a feminist critique of the treatment of women during the Victorian era. In the story, the protagonist’s husband, a doctor, forbids her from doing anything that might excite her, including reading and writing.
