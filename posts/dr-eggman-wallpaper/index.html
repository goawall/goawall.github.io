There are many different types of wallpaper on the market, so make sure to select one that is appropriate for your project.</p></li><li><p>Prepare the surface.

A sharp knife and level are essential for cutting and hanging wallpaper correctly.</p></li><li><p>Take your time. Rushing through the job will likely result in mistakes, so take your time and be patient.</p></li><li><p>Hang from the top down.
